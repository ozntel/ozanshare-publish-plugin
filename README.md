This plugin allows you to publish your Markdown Notes with a single click directly from your Obsidian vault.

Each of your published files will have unique code, which is only available to you. You can share with someone the link and republish once you make small changes. It will keep the same `code` and `URL`.

**IMPORTANT**: 
- This is not an open source project. 
- Make sure that you are using Obsidian's version `0.12.16` or above. This is the version, which gives access to the plugin to send `Request with Header` and create `Mermaids`. You can check from `Settings > About`:

- The plugin is only available to users, who are on `Exclusive Support Level` on `Buy Me a Coffee`. Once you are in this support level, I will send you the `TOKEN` you can use for the plugin:

    </a>

- Make sure that you provide your `Email address` while you join the `Exclusive Support Level` so that I can deliver you the `TOKEN`:

- You can also reach me out directly using the details from [Contact](#Contact) below to find out more.

**REMEMBER**: 
- This is still early stage for the plugin. There might be some bugs and missing features, which will be gradually improved, implemented. I will be grateful for your kind patience in case you see any bug, error and report me as soon as possible so that I can work on it.
- For the moment, the plugin will be available on Desktop only. Once I find a solution for the error, I plan to allow on mobile, as well.

## Plugin Description

1. You need to be on `Exclusive Support Level` on `Buy Me a Coffee` to be able to use the plugin. You will receive a `TOKEN` from me to be able to use the plugin and publish feature. For the moment, only limited people can be on this support level. Once you enter the `TOKEN` in plugin settings and click verify, you can start enjoying all features available: <a href="https://www.buymeacoffee.com/ozante" target="_blank">Exclusive Support Level</a>

2. You can `Publish` your notes and all relevant linked notes to the main published note with a single click from the `Context Menu` of the file in the vault:

7. As long as you don't unpublish your notes and change the place of the file in the vault, the `Republish` function will keep the old publish references. It will help you to update the files you have already shared with someone. You won't need to send a new link.

8. `Images` are uploaded to Firebase server, which are also served with a secret token. Image source with the provided token is automatically embedded into your final publish on OzanShare. 

9. Each publish triggers a scan of your `Published Files` and `Vault`. It means you shouldn't remove the references from `Frontmatter` manually by hand since it will trigger removing the published note from the server. You should rather use `Unpublish` button if you don't need the note anymore to be shared. This will remove the shared note from the server.

10. You can open the published notes on `Web Application` directly from the `Context Menu` or `Copy URL`, which allows to access the note on web.
