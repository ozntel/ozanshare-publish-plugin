# OzanShare Publish Plugin

This plugin allows you to publish your markdown notes with a single click directly from your Obsidian vault.

**IMPORTANT**: This plugin is exclusive to users, who are on `Exclusive` Support level on `BuyMeCoffee`.

## Plugin Description

1. You need to be on `Exclusive` Support Level on `BuyMeCoffee` to be able to use the plugin. You will receive a **TOKEN** from me to be able to use the plugin and publish feature. For the moment, only limited people can be on this support level. Once you enter the `Token` in plugin settings and click verify, you can start enjoying all features available: <a href="https://www.buymeacoffee.com/ozante" target="_blank">Exclusive Support Level</a>

2. You can **PUBLISH** your notes and all related notes to the main note with a single click from the **CONTEXT MENU** of the file.

3. Your pages are going to be served on [https://ozanshare.web.app/](https://ozanshare.web.app/)

3. Plugin **RENDERS** as HTML:

	- Admonitions
	- Transclusions (even nested)
	- Linked Files
	- Mermaids
	- Code Blocks
	- Any Basic Markdown String

4. You can also add your **Custom CSS**.

5. You can view all your published notes from the **LEAF** created for plugin. Just click the **Ribbon Icon**

6. As long as you don't unpublish your notes and change the place of the file in the vault, the **REPUBLISH** will *keep the old references*. It will help you to update the files you have already shared with someone. You won't need to send a new link.

7. **IMAGES** are uploaded to Firebase server, which are also served with a secret token. Image source with the provided token is automatically embedded into your final publish on OzanShare. 

8. Each publish triggers a scan of your **PUBLISHED FILES** and **VAULT**. It means you shouldn't remove the references from **FRONTMATTER** manually by hand since it will trigger removing the published note from the server. You should use **UNPUBLISH** feature if you don't need the note anymore to be shared.

9. You can open the published note on **Web Application** directly from **CONTEXT MENU**
